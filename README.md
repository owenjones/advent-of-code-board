# Advent of Code Board
An Advent of Code leaderboard for sticking up on a wall/screen somewhere

A bit of a WIP - currently shows info about the AOC and your leaderboard code so people can join (and also a Christmas tree with tappable baubles).

It will eventually pull the leaderboard and show it alongside.

## Setting up
You need npm installed. Add your public url (and leaderboard invite code if you want to display that) to .env.local, then `npm run build` to build the app. Copy the build folder to wherever you're hosting this thing and you're good to go üëç
